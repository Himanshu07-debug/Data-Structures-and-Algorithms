<h1>RECURSION</h1>

<br>

**Things You should do --**

1. Trust the function that it will give me right answer for the Input that I will give.
2. Think Yourself as a Lazy person, If You are ask for the answer of n, You will say that ki n-1 ka answer(subproblem example) dedo, Tabhi n ka dunga.
3. Do small work and Ask Recursion to do remaining work.

<br>
<br>


**Thinking for Subproblems --**

1. What Do you need to construct Your answer. Suppose If someone is very kind and give you the answer for what is required by you, Constructing answer for Your Problem will be a Cake Walk..
2. Think n ko solve krna hard hai, kya values < n ko solve krna easy hai kya..

<br>

**RECURSION TREE**

1. Making Recursion Tree is most Important, You do not have to draw in Interviews, but You have to imagine..
2. In Recursion Tree, consider the function parameters in the node which are changing on calls, not the static ones

<br>
<br>

**How to implement --**

1. Properly defines your function.. (You should be clear what apka function represent kar rha hai..) and Think about the parameters for the Function..
2. Transition ( Recurrence relation )
3. **Base case -** input where Your Transition equation will fail
4. **Final Subproblem --** Final Problem that is asked in Question.. ( Root of recursion tree )

<br>
<br>


**TIME AND SPACE OF THE RECURSION**

1. **Time** 
    > If Transition time -> <br>
    **Same for each node ->** No. of nodes * Transition time of each node <br>
    **Different for each node ->** Calculate the sum of each node transition time
    

2. **Space** ->  Height of the Tree
